== HEAD
	* Modify IChannel#empty?

		It now returns true in case the underlying UNIXSocket being used as a 
		reader is closed.

== v3.1.0
	* Add IChannel#empty?.
	
		IChannel#empty? returns true when the channel is empty(nothing to read).
	
	* Micro speed improvement on #write!, & #recv! operations.

		By passing nil instead of creating two empty arrays for every read/write 
		operation we should see a very small improvement in their performance.

	* Add ChangeLog.txt
