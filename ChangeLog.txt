== v5.0.0
	* Remove IChannel#empty?
	
	I think the #readable? method is all you need, since the inverse of 
	#readable? is the same as #empty? (at least in terms of logic).

== v4.1.0
	* Add IChannel#readable?

	A method that can tell you whether or not a read would block. 
	When it returns true, a read shouldn't block, on the other hand
	if it were false it'd likely block by the time you call #get.

== v4.0.0
	* Modify IChannel#empty?

		It now returns true in case the underlying UNIXSocket being used as a 
		reader is closed.

== v3.1.0
	* Add IChannel#empty?.
	
		IChannel#empty? returns true when the channel is empty(nothing to read).
	
	* Micro speed improvement on #write!, & #recv! operations.

		By passing nil instead of creating two empty arrays for every read/write 
		operation we should see a very small improvement in their performance.

	* Add ChangeLog.txt
